## To-Do List

### Bug Fixes / Optimization
* Look into $terminalText bug. Maybe find a better way of displaying colors then current method
* Code cleanup
* Update Screenshots
* Better way of changing text color (use ""-text blue"" or "-text red" rather then "-red" or "-blue")
* Test Units (For growing information such as hardware models and OSX versions)
* Add manual install instructions in manual for those who don't want to use installer
* Add color to disk info. Display Green /Yellow / Red for amount of space left. (Option to turn off)

### Features
* Look into being able to install via package manager (homebrew / macports)
* Resolution information
* Easy way to change info being displayed (maybe a config file ?)
